The objective of this assignment is to work with a real-world dataset, focusing on data preprocessing, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and effectively communicating your insights.
Dataset Overview:
Source and Description of the Dataset:
The dataset used for this assignment is titled "Electric Vehicle Population Data" and can be found
on Data.gov: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data
Provided by the State of Washington, this dataset displays information about battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) currently registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing. Data is separated into 17 different columns, showing each vehicleâ€™s VIN, county and city of registration, make and model, electric type and electric range. Vehicle model years range from 2013 to the current year, with metadata being routinely updated by the Washington government.
Requirements:
Provide answers to the following questions as possible as you can. Provide a brief description, including the number of examples, number and type of features, and context.
Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:
1. Document Missing Values: Check for missing values and document their frequency and
distribution across features.
2. Missing Value Strategies: If missing values are present, apply multiple strategies (e.g.,
mean/median imputation, dropping rows) and compare their impact on the analysis.
3. Feature Encoding: Encode categorical features (e.g., Make, Model) using techniques like
one-hot encoding.
 
4. Normalization: Normalize numerical features if necessary for chosen analysis methods. Exploratory Data Analysis:
5. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical features.
6. Spatial Distribution: Visualize the spatial distribution of EVs across locations (e.g., maps).
7. Model Popularity: Analyze the popularity of different EV models (categorical data) and
identify any trends.
8. Investigate the relationship between every pair of numeric features. Are there any
correlations? Explain the results.
Visualization:
9. Data Exploration Visualizations: Create various visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter
plots, boxplots) to explore the relationships between features.
10. Comparative Visualization: Compare the distribution of EVs across different locations
(cities, counties) using bar charts or stacked bar charts.
Additional Analysis:
11. Temporal Analysis (Optional): If the dataset includes data across multiple time points,
analyze the temporal trends in EV adoption rates and model popularity.
